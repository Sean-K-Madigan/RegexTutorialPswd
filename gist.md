# Password Validation with Regex

In this tutorial, we will explore a regular expression (regex) designed for validating passwords. Password validation is crucial in web development to ensure user accounts' security and integrity. The regex we will dissect ensures that a password meets specific criteria, such as length and character composition, to enhance security.

## Summary

We will be examining the following regex, which is used for password validation:

```
/^[a-zA-Z0-9?!@#$%^&*]{8,16}$/
```

This regex validates that a password is between 6 to 16 characters long and can contain letters (both uppercase and lowercase), numbers, and special characters (!@#$%^&*). Our tutorial will break down each component of this regex to understand how it functions in detail.

## Regex Components

### Anchors

```^``` and ```$``` are anchors that match the beginning and end of the string, respectively, ensuring the entire string matches the pattern. These anchors indicate to the program that it is going to perform some text processing to ensure specified criteria are met.

### Quantifiers

```{8,16}``` is a quantifier that matches the preceding token (in this case, the character set) between 8 and 16 times, enforcing the password length requirement. Meaning that any password must be at least 8 characters long but cannot be more than 16. 

### Grouping Constructs

This regex does not use grouping constructs (```()```), as it does not require capturing groups for validation.

### Bracket Expressions

```[a-zA-Z0-9?!@#$%^&*]``` is a bracket expression that matches any single character contained within the brackets, allowing for a mix of alphanumeric and specified special characters in the password.

### Character Classes

Within the bracket expression, ```a-zA-Z0-9``` are character classes that match any lowercase letter (```a-z```), any uppercase letter (```A-Z```), and any digit (```0-9```).

### The OR Operator

This regex does not explicitly use the OR operator (```|```), as the bracket expression inherently allows for any character within it to match.

### Flags

This regex does not include flags, but they can be added to modify the behavior of the regex (e.g., case-insensitive matching).

### Character Escapes

Special characters like ```?!@#$%^&*``` do not need to be escaped within a bracket expression, so this regex does not contain character escapes.

My name is Sean and I am a new web developer builiding my own skillset in this arena. I enjoy teaching others as I feel it is the best way to solidify knowledge in ones own mind. I find this regex particularly uselful in my projects for implementing appropriately secure passwords and keeping my users data safe.
